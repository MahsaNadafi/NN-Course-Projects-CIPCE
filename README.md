# Neural Networks & Deep Learning — Course Assignments (Fall 2022)

**School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, College of Engineering,  
University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran**

This repository contains my assignment submissions for the **Deep Neural Networks** course offered at the University of Tehran in Fall 2022, instructed by **Dr. Ahmad Kalhor**.

The assignments cover a broad set of foundational and advanced concepts in neural networks, including **perceptrons and logistic regression, multilayer feedforward networks, optimization and regularization, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and autoencoders / representation learning**.
