# Neural Networks & Deep Learning — Course Assignments (Fall 2022)

**School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, College of Engineering,  
University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran**

This repository contains my assignment submissions for the Neural Networks & Deep Learning course offered at the University of Tehran in Fall 2022, instructed by Dr. Ahmad Kalhor.
Across these assignments, I implemented and analyzed a wide range of modern deep-learning methods—from perceptrons and feedforward networks to CNNs for image classification, transfer learning, object detection, recurrent models for sequence prediction, transformers and BERT, and finally GANs for generative modeling. The course progressively covers both theoretical foundations and hands-on projects using real-world datasets.
